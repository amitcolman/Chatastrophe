name: LLM05:2025 Improper Output Handling
description: Insufficient validation, sanitization, and handling of the outputs generated by large language models
category: IMPROPER_OUTPUT_HANDLING
mitigations:
  - Apply proper input validation on responses coming from the model to backend functions
  - Encode model output back to users
  - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database operations involving LLM output
  - Employ strict Content Security Policies (CSP)
  - Implement robust logging and monitoring systems to detect unusual patterns
