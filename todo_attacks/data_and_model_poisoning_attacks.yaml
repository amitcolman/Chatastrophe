name: LLM04:2025 Data and Model Poisoning
description: Pre-training, fine-tuning, or embedding data is manipulated to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or biases
category: DATA_AND_MODEL_POISONING
mitigations:
  - Track data origins and transformations
  - Validate model outputs against trusted sources
  - Use anomaly detection techniques to filter out adversarial data
  - Tailor models for different use cases
  - Track changes in datasets and detect manipulation

attacks:
  - name: Test Attack 1
    description: This is a test attack 1
